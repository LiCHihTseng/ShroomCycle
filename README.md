## Introduction
**shroomCycle** is designed to promote healthy sleep habits in a group of friends. 
Each lamp features lights corresponding to each user, that respond to changes in ambient lighting, turning on when someone in the group begins preparing for bed.
When a user places their phone on a pad at the base of their lamp, their corresponding LED light turns off, signaling to the others that they are going to sleep/sleeping. 
This creates a **shared sense of accountability within the group**. Hence the system fosters better sleep routines by subtly indicating who is asleep, encouraging more consistent sleep patterns among the users.

## Purpose
"You miss 100% of the naps you don’t take." — Unknown

Poor sleep hygiene can negatively impact academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. University students, in particular, often face challenges in maintaining healthy sleep routines due to fluctuating class schedules, social commitments, and late-night study sessions (Lu et al., 2023).

**ShroomCycle** aims to address these issues by helping _university students improve their sleep hygiene_. 

*Our goal is to create a platform where friends can support each other in establishing better sleep cycles. By making sleep improvement a shared experience, we hope to foster healthier sleep habits that enhance both academic success and personal well-being.*

## Social and Mobile
**Social (Collaborative) Computing**
The lamp creates a network where each user's action (placing their phone down) affects others. This shared experience creates a sense of community and mutual accountability.

**Mobile (Contextual) Computing**
Being placed in the bedroom, the lamp is positioned to help with the user's bedtime routines, making it contextually relevant to the sleep environment.


## Design Iterations
During the creation of ShroomCycle, we went through two major design iterations, refining both the aesthetics and functionality of the product. Each iteration was driven by user feedback and technical considerations, ensuring that the final product would be safe, functional, and visually appealing.

<h4>Initial Prototype: Testing Basic Functionality</h4>
Before finalizing the design, we tested the mushroom concept with users and received mostly positive feedback: out of 42 participants, only 12 expressed dissatisfaction or felt indifferent about the design.

The first design focused on testing the core components of ShroomCycle, particularly the integration of pressure sensors and LEDs. This initial prototype was a proof of concept aimed at determining whether the system could successfully detect when a phone was placed in the lamp and whether the lights could be turned off accordingly. While this prototype achieved basic functionality, it raised concerns about the wiring layout, as too much exposed wiring posed a potential hazard.

<h4>Iteration #1: Introducing the Mushroom Design</h4>
After identifying issues with exposed wiring in the initial design, we pivoted to the mushroom-shaped lamp, which offered better space for cable management and a cleaner design. This mushroom design was not only safer but also allowed for more creative flexibility in housing the electronics. We integrated an Ambient Light Sensor in this iteration, enabling the lamp to detect when the room became dark and automatically adjust the lighting accordingly, enhancing its usability in varied lighting conditions.

<h4>Building the Mushroom</h4>
This phase focused on constructing the physical prototype of the mushroom lamp. The design was crafted to hide all cables neatly within the mushroom's stem, offering both a minimalist aesthetic and a functional solution for cable management. The build incorporated pressure sensors, LEDs, and ambient light sensors, ensuring that the prototype was not only safe but also responsive to user interactions.

<h4>Final Prototype: User Testing and Feedback</h4>
Once the mushroom prototype was completed, we conducted a more comprehensive user evaluation using a survey to gather feedback. Participants engaged with ShroomCycle and shared their thoughts on its functionality and design. The survey can be accessed here. This feedback was crucial for understanding user preferences and refining the product further.

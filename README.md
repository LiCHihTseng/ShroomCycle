## Introduction
**shroomCycle** is designed to promote healthy sleep habits in a group of friends. 
Each lamp features lights corresponding to each user, that respond to changes in ambient lighting, turning on when someone in the group begins preparing for bed.
When a user places their phone on a pad at the base of their lamp, their corresponding LED light turns off, signaling to the others that they are going to sleep/sleeping. 
This creates a **shared sense of accountability within the group**. Hence the system fosters better sleep routines by subtly indicating who is asleep, encouraging more consistent sleep patterns among the users.

## Purpose
"You miss 100% of the naps you don’t take." — Unknown

Poor sleep hygiene can negatively impact academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. University students, in particular, often face challenges in maintaining healthy sleep routines due to fluctuating class schedules, social commitments, and late-night study sessions (Lu et al., 2023).

**ShroomCycle** aims to address these issues by helping _university students improve their sleep hygiene_. 

*Our goal is to create a platform where friends can support each other in establishing better sleep cycles. By making sleep improvement a shared experience, we hope to foster healthier sleep habits that enhance both academic success and personal well-being.*

## Social and Mobile
**Social (Collaborative) Computing**
The lamp creates a network where each user's action (placing their phone down) affects others. This shared experience creates a sense of community and mutual accountability.

**Mobile (Contextual) Computing**
Being placed in the bedroom, the lamp is positioned to help with the user's bedtime routines, making it contextually relevant to the sleep environment.
